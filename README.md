## Project Description

This project is an online shopping view-only portal designed to provide users with a seamless browsing experience. It allows users to view products, filter items based on names, and explore detailed product information without the ability to make purchases. The portal features a user-friendly interface with responsive design, ensuring accessibility on various devices. The primary goal of the portal is to offer an intuitive shopping experience by displaying product listings, images, descriptions, and pricing, making it easy for users to explore products before deciding to make a purchase on another platform.
